# New-Stock-Price-Page
A PHP webpage that shows live stock prices using data from the IEX Trading API. This version uses batch requests to improve speed.

Place all files in the same folder. Put everything inside the HTDOCS folder of your local server environment. This versiom of the stock page uses multiple loops to condense stock arrays into a single API call, rather than issuing multiple sequential calls.
